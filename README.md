# extract-actuators-iccprt

This python script will give the list of all the actuators in the plant classified by its CP. The data source for this script is the same created for the [block-search program](https://github.com/faseelmo/blocksearch-iccprt). This script is a useful tool when replacements of CPs are required. It gives information about the actuators connected to corresponding CPs and therefore decisions can be taken to force the value of the actuators/sensors in DCS.
